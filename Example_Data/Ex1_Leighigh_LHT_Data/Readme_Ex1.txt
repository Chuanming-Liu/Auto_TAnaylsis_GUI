1. For this example, the data type is LHT, and we remove the instrument responses before rotation, so when you use the T component data do not click the 'Remove Resp' button,
and you also do not need to offer the RESP files. 
2. The station list file for the example is ./Necessary/SETibetArraySta.dat
3. Use the ./Necessary/Tibet_Love_phase_v_ref.dat as the reference dispersion curve.
